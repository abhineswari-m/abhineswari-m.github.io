🟧 I'm a final year Master's student @ VIT Chennai.

🟨 At the [Computational Imaging Lab](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/comp_photolab/) @ IIT Madras, I work as an intern under the supervision of Prof [Dr. Kaushik Mitra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cZBq_9MAAAAJ&hl=en).

🟩 My research interests lie in 3D Computer Vision, Vision Language Models, Multi-Modal Learning.

🟥 I've spent my summers working with Prof [Dr. Anitha Christaline J](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Ja-a1aUAAAAJ), [Dr. Saranyaraj D](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ffArHaUAAAAJ) and [Dr. Kaja Mohideen A](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pG56bV0AAAAJ&hl=en).

🟦 My interests also lie at the intersection of Generative AI and geometric perception with
sensors, bridging the gap between raw pixels and high-level spatial reasoning.

🟪 I'm also applying for PhD positions for FALL 2026!

## Miscellaneous

🍝 I trade my keyboard for a spatula trying indian/italian meals.
